Obscvrat is a harsh noise and experimental sound project rooted in putrid underground. Grounded in sewers of obscurity, voltage, and vermin instinct, Obscvrat channels raw electrical pressure into immersive sonic environments where structure collapses and texture becomes narrative.

### Origin

<div class="two-columns">

Emerging from a background in noise culture, and black metal aesthetics, Obscvrat rejects polish in favor of abrasion. Recordings are built from crumbling textures, infected field recordings, broken circuits, and [analog filth](/gear/)—

Each set functions as a **controlled collapse**: from distorted signal chains, unstable feedback systems, field recordings, and fractured rhythms—designed to a ritual of corrosion, pestilence, and repetition.

### Etymology

The name Obscvrat—derived from *Obscure*, *Command Voltage*, and *Rat*—reflects the project's philosophy: operating in the margins, guided by circuitry, thriving in neglected spaces.

Obscvrat navigates cracks in systems—technological, social, and aesthetic—turning overlooked noise into **gnawing presence**.

### Symbol

No words. Only weight.

<div class="two-columns">

The rat serves as both symbol and method: filth as rebellion, plague as transformation, the stray's death as ritual prey. Releases adopt minimal visual language and lo-fi physical formats, emphasizing impermanence and resistance to commodification.

Obscvrat exists outside genre convenience—too harsh for ambient, too abstract for metal, too physical for pure electronics. It stands as an **anti-product**, a **moving archive of distortion**, documentation of collapse, and celebration in the shadow.

### Position

In a culture obsessed with clarity and optimization, Obscvrat insists on noise, friction, and the rodenticide's curse.
