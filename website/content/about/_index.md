## Obscvrat: Noisework & Sonic Experimentation

Obscvrat is a noisework project dedicated to exploring the boundaries between sound and silence, music and noise. Through live performances and sonic installations, we investigate unconventional approaches to sound design and acoustic expression.

### Mission

We believe that sound exists beyond conventional musical frameworks. Our work challenges listeners to reconsider their relationship with audio, examining how noise, texture, and timbre can communicate meaning and emotion independent of traditional melody or harmony.

### Sound Philosophy

Our approach to noisework draws from:
- **Industrial & Experimental Music**: Embracing harsh, raw, and unconventional sonic textures
- **Field Recording & Sampling**: Capturing and transforming environmental sounds into compositional elements
- **Live Electronics**: Using synthesizers, effects, and analog signal processing to sculpt sound in real-time
- **Physical Modulation**: Exploring the acoustic properties of various materials and objects

### Performance Practice

Obscvrat performances are immersive sonic experiences. Each session is unique, incorporating:
- Live mixing and manipulation of layered sound sources
- Interaction with venue acoustics and spatial properties
- Audience engagement through unpredictable sonic events
- Collaboration with other sound artists and performers

### Influences

Our sonic palette is influenced by pioneers in experimental and noise music, including:
- Merzbow and Japanese noise pioneers
- Alvin Lucier's acoustic experiments
- Pierre Schaeffer's musique concrète
- Contemporary power electronics and industrial artists
