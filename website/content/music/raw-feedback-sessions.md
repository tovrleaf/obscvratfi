<p>**Raw Feedback Sessions** documents a series of live studio experiments exploring the boundaries between intentional composition and accidental discovery. These unedited recordings capture the raw sonic potential of feedback loops, analog synthesis, and real-time manipulation.</p>

<p>## Recording Sessions</p>

<p>This collection spans sessions from January to March 2023, capturing the creative process without extensive post-production. Each track represents a focused exploration of specific sonic territories.</p>

<p>## Tracks</p>

<p>1. **Oscillation Study #1** - Pure sine wave feedback at various frequencies<br>
2. **Resonance Decay** - Capturing the harmonic characteristics of different materials<br>
3. **Circuit Bending Sessions** - Intentional electronic circuit manipulation<br>
4. **Environmental Feedback** - Processing sounds from urban environments<br>
5. **Analog Cascade** - Series of synthesizers feeding into each other</p>

<p>## Technical Notes</p>

<p>- Recorded directly to stereo tape with minimal monitoring<br>
- No digital editing; tracks are presented as recorded<br>
- Analog warmth and tape compression intact<br>
- Raw, unpolished aesthetic celebrating imperfection</p>
