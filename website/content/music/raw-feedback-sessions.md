**Raw Feedback Sessions** documents a series of live studio experiments exploring the boundaries between intentional composition and accidental discovery. These unedited recordings capture the raw sonic potential of feedback loops, analog synthesis, and real-time manipulation.

## Recording Sessions

This collection spans sessions from January to March 2023, capturing the creative process without extensive post-production. Each track represents a focused exploration of specific sonic territories.

## Tracks

1. **Oscillation Study #1** - Pure sine wave feedback at various frequencies
2. **Resonance Decay** - Capturing the harmonic characteristics of different materials
3. **Circuit Bending Sessions** - Intentional electronic circuit manipulation
4. **Environmental Feedback** - Processing sounds from urban environments
5. **Analog Cascade** - Series of synthesizers feeding into each other

## Technical Notes

- Recorded directly to stereo tape with minimal monitoring
- No digital editing; tracks are presented as recorded
- Analog warmth and tape compression intact
- Raw, unpolished aesthetic celebrating imperfection
