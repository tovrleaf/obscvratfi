**Fractured Frequencies** explores the sonic potential of error, malfunction, and digital corruption. Through heavy processing and feedback chains, this work celebrates the unintended beauty of broken systems and audio artifacts.

### Concept

This album is a celebration of imperfection. Each track uses different techniques to generate and manipulate harsh, distorted textures that challenge conventional notions of musicality.

### Process

Created using:
- Analog feedback loops and circuit bending
- Digital glitch techniques and bit-crushing
- Extreme EQ and distortion processing
- Real-time mixing and effects manipulation

### Release Information

Limited edition digital release with extended soundscape versions included as bonus tracks.
