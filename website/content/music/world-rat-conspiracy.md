<p>From the putrid underground sewers of harsh noise, three rodent-worshipping forces unite for a split that will gnaw your flesh and bone until nothing but black death remains.</p>

<p>OBSCVRAT (Finland), feeds on crumbling textures, walks the death march of broken circuits, with infected field recordings and analog filth.</p>

<p>ROTAT (Finland) approaches with industrial violence and electroacoustic sickness. His unhinged tape manipulations and steel-scraping feedbacks vermin mutilation as audio ritual.</p>

<p>WHITERAT (Italy) destroys with blistering HNW and detuned power electronics. Whiterat tends to be calm, but can bite if it feel threatened.</p>

<p>Each project contributes an original ode to the rat, a symbol of filth, survival, rebellion, and gnawing truth. Strictly underground. Strictly unclean.</p>

<p>Enter the nest of decay where no light escapes; rats don’t die, they multiple.</p>

<p>Which rat are you?</p>

<p>Obscvrat track Funeral Rattus Rituale is cut in the middle in the end of side A and it continues on side B.</p>
